    My main goal in learning python is to able to apply it in collaboration with my civil engineering education. My two main interests the Built Environment (a sustainable and  healthier approach to planning and building)  and Building Information Modeling (BIM) which ensures a more efficient and collaborative process in the architectural, engineering and construction industry. A lot of the software programs that support BIM require building plug ins to provide collaboration platforms between the different firms that are working on projects together. Compas is an open source python framework for the AEC industry that aims to simplify multidisciplinary collaboration.
