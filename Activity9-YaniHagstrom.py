#1: Write a function that given a list will print out all the values in the list:

# myList1 = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "mango", "guava", "grapes"]

# def printMyValues(myList1):
#     for i in myList1:
#         print(i)

# printMyValues(myList1)
    #This way you can call your function for ANY list and print out all the values in the list you called. 



#2: Write a function that takes in one integer as a parameter and will print out your name as many times as specified by the argument:

myName = "Yani\n"

def printXTimes(xTimes = 0):
    printName = myName * xTimes
    return printName

print(printXTimes(5))
