# Counter Variable

# sum = 0
# i = 1

# while(i < 10):

#Do-While
# it performs one thing before running a loop

# i = 0

# while(i <= 15):
#     i = i + 1 
#     print(f" I am in the while loop and it has run {i} times so far")





# For Loops:
    #Three components:
        #1: Initializing the Index/Counter
        #2: Creating the condition
        #3: Incramentation

for index in range(0,10):
    print(index)
